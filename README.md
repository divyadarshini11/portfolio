## Projects

#### **KERAULite: An end-to-end Keratoconus Classification and Segmentation using Ultra-Lightweight 2D CNNs**
- Designed a feature extraction module to capture multiscale linear and non-linear patterns present in keratoconus image datasets.
- Engineered an ultra-lightweight CNN by modifying the architecture of a conventional CNN for keratoconus detection, achieving 86% classification accuracy with only 2,768 parameters.
- Obtained a 6% accuracy trade-off compared to conventional CNNs while reducing model size by over 98%.
- Implemented UNet++ for segmentation of non-linear keratoconus patterns, attaining 98% segmentation accuracy.

#### **RAG-based Medical Chatbot with Huggingface, LangChain, FAISS & Streamlit** [Click here](https://github.com/divyadarshini11/medical-bot)
- Streamlined a RAG-based chatbot (GaleBot) using the GALE Encyclopedia of Medicine as the knowledge source.
- Used LangChain, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer for text embeddings, FAISS for semantic similarity-based retrieval, and Mistral-7B LLM  for response generation.
- Deloyed the application on Streamlit for real-time medical Q\A. [GaleBot App](https://medical-bot-kosgq4nqutwueyeey6mlbj.streamlit.app/)
